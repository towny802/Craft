# This Is My CEG-4110 Spring 2020 Project
**by Dexter Wurn, Nate Schrider, Stephen Moore, Zach Bechoefer, Nathan Dunkman, and Brody Engle-Burdette**

## Modified-Craft

Minecraft clone for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Just a few thousand lines of C using modern OpenGL (shaders). Online multiplayer support is included using a Python-based server.

Our project used [Fogleman Craft](http://www.michaelfogleman.com/craft/) as our starting point

### Install Dependencies

#### Mac OS X

Download and install [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
if you don't already have it. You may use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) to simplify
the installation:

    brew install cmake

#### Linux (Ubuntu)

    sudo apt-get install cmake libglew-dev xorg-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
    sudo apt-get build-dep glfw
    sudo apt-get install libalut-dev
    sudo apt install libopenal-dev
    sudo apt install sox

#### Windows

Download and install [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
and [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/). Add `C:\MinGW\bin` to your `PATH`.

Download and install [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/download.html) so that
CURL/lib and CURL/include are in your Program Files directory.

Use the following commands in place of the ones described in the next section.

    cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles"
    mingw32-make

### Compile and Run

Once you have the dependencies (see above), run the following commands in your
terminal.

    git clone https://github.com/towny802/Craft.git
    cd Craft
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    cd ..
    ./build/craft

### Controls

- WASD to move forward, left, backward, right.
- Space to jump.
- Left Click to destroy a block.
- Right Click or Cmd + Left Click to create a block.
- Ctrl + Right Click to toggle a block as a light source.
- 1-9 to select the block type to create.
- E to cycle through the block types.
- Tab to toggle between walking and flying.
- ZXCVBN to move in exact directions along the XYZ axes.
- Q to zoom.
- F to show the scene in orthographic mode.
- O to observe players in the main view.
- P to observe players in the picture-in-picture view.
- T to type text into chat.
- Forward slash (/) to enter a command.
- Backquote (`) to write text on any block (signs).
- Arrow keys emulate mouse movement.
